# RockPaperScissor
A rock paper scissors tournament.

 Play one round of RPS.
		Choices of 'r', 'p', or 's' shall follow standard RPS rules.
		A choice of 'r', 'p', or 's' shall always beat any other choice that is
		not one of 'r', 'p', or 's'. If both players choose something that is not
		'r', 'p', or 's', then they draw.

Plays a heads-up RPS tournament.
		A player wins the tournament if, at any point, they have won 3 more
		rounds than the other player. If the tournament reaches 20 rounds, then
		the player who has won the most rounds wins the tournament. If there is a
		tie after 20 rounds, then the tournament has 5 more rounds of sudden death
		play. In sudden death, the tournament is won by the first player to win a
		round. If all 25 rounds complete without a winner, then the tournament is
		a draw.
